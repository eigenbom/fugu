Q. XCode issues
A. Maybe BaseSDK (Use Mac OS..)

Q. fgv crashes with a message like:
	error loading module 'tests/basic5' from file '/Users/beporter/dev/lib/lua-5.1.4':
	cannot read /Users/beporter/dev/lib/lua-5.1.4: Is a directory

A. Make sure the environment variable LUA_PATH is not defined, as Lua uses this to search for modules. E.g., run fgv as follows:
	env LUA_PATH= ./fgv tests/basic5
