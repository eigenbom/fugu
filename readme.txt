fg|fugu|fugue readme.txt

fg is a system for procedurally generating animated geometric forms in real-time. It is currently under heavy development and as such should not be used at all, by anyone, under any circumstances.

Building Instructions
=====================
First make sure you have the following dependencies:

CMake 2.8
GLEW and GLFW (libs included for Windows/MinGW)

fg uses CMake to build. As such, it should be possible to output project files for Xcode, Visual Studio, etc. Some build scripts are provided (osx-make-build.sh and eclipse-msw-build.bat) that generate a basic Unix Makefile project for OSX and an Eclipse Makefile project under windows. To generate other projects you will need to write your own scripts (patches welcome!).

OSX/Make
--------
> ./osx-make-build.sh
> cd build/osx-make
> make 

Running an example (from directory build/osx-make)
> src/misc/basics/view_universe ../../scripts/test basic3

Windows/MinGW/Eclipse
---------------------
> eclipse-msw-build.bat
> cd build\eclipse-msw
> make

Running an example (from directory build/eclipse-msw)
> src\misc\basics\view_universe.exe ..\..\scripts\test basic3

NB: The eclipse build script generates TWO eclipse projects. One in the root directory that contains all the source. And one in build\eclipse-msw that contains the targets. This discrepancy is due to the way eclipse works.

Directory Structure
===================
build/ generated by the build-script, will contain the project files and binaries after compilation
include/ and src/ contains the source, including some dependencies
scripts/ contains the fg lua scripts
lib/ contains compiled libraries of some dependencies
tools/ contains misc tools (e.g., a script for importing objs to blender for animation)
